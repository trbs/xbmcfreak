# /etc/live-snapshot resync list example
#
# If this file is present, each uncommented not empty line will be parsed when
# running live-snapshot and included in target snapshot.
#
# The syntax for the line is just a full file or directory pathname.
# Those files and directories, and only those will be included on automatic persistence handling.
#
# Note that in home-sn snapshot all those paths are treated as relative to /home

# Include itself for reuse
/etc/live-snapshot.list

# Include networking setups
/etc/network/interfaces
/etc/resolv.conf
/etc/hosts

# Include the whole Desktop directory of the default user
/home/user/Desktop
